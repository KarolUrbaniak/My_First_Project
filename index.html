                <h3>E-sport</h3>
                <p>
                  I love playing competitive games. Some of my favorite titles that I've played on an amateur/team level include two FPS games.
                   The first was Counter-Strike Global: Offensive by <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/pl/">Valve Corporation</a>.
                   The second was Valorant by <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">Riot Games</a>. In addition, occasionally, I play Fifa, produced by <a href="https://www.ea.com/pl-pl">EA Sports</a>.

                <h3>Anime</h3>
                <p>
                  I have been keen on anime since 2017. I love such series as Attack on Titan,
                   Naruto, Jujutsu Kaisen, or Demon Slayer. I reckon that anime can present us with
                    some stories in a better way than the adaptation of the same novel in regular cinema.

                <h3>Front-End Programming</h3>
                <p>
                  My adventure with web development started back in college. Since that time,
                   I have been looking for what I want to do in the IT industry, and I concluded
                    that working on the front-end is what I like, and I'm pretty good at it. Currently,
                     I'm learning the Angular framework, and in the future, I intend to try working with
                      the Django framework wheater I gain some experience in web application development.
                       I want to grow in web development and become better every day at what I do.
                       I'm providing a link here to my repository on <a href="https://github.com/KarolUrbaniak">GitHub</a>. I'm an ambitious person but
                        still improving as a front-end developer, so please be understanding of me.

                <h3>Cinema</h3>
                <p>
                  I've been a connoisseur of cinema practically forever. I prefer watching action,
                  fantasy, science fiction, comedy or horror movies. I know many actors, but I don't have my favorite one. However,
                   if I had to choose, works of such actors as Joaquin Phoenix, Christian Bale, or Leonardo DiCaprio would be on my list.
                </p>

              <img src="sport.png"/>
              <div>
                <h3>Sport</h3>
                <p>
                  I have been actively supporting the Polish national football team for ten years. I am a big fan of striker Robert Lewandowski.
                   I firmly believe that we will go far at the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
                   After a successful debut, coach Czeslaw Michniewicz showed class and gave me hope for the excellent development of the Polish national team.
